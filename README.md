# ThompsonSamplinginRestlessBandits
Thompson Sampling implementation in a restless bandit problem (Gilbertâ€“Elliott channel model)

The algorithms are described and theoretically analayzed in the following work.

If you use this code in your paper, please cite the above work. Although it is based on this we cannot guarantee that the algorithm will work exactly, or even produce the same output, as any of these implementations.
